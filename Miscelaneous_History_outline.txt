##CHP (Combined Heat and Power Unit)

This was a posh name for a diesel lorry engine running on gasified wood pellets.

It provided heated water for the heat exchange tanks in our houses and generated electricity for around the first year that BedZed had residents, around 2002. The prototype unit sooted up due to moisture in the pellets and had to be regularly shut down for cleaning. After a couple of years, around 2004 it was decommissioned.

We always had the back-up gas boilers. These were used for a few years until we were able to get a woodchip burner. Both now act as the source for the heated water for the heat exchange tanks in our houses. However they don’t provide electricy

##The living machine - Organic sewage treatment

At the launch of BedZed we had what was referred to as a ‘living machine’ the only problem was that it needed looking after. You can still see the greenhouse-like section on top of the Pavilion. Sewage was filtered through a system of reeds and beetles. The ‘machine’ needed a technician to monitor and make adjustments and I understand this cost was deemed too much to keep it going.

For a time Thames Water supplied us with a system with an organic membrane, it was behind the fence next to our allotments, nut this project shit down done years ago.

We are now connected to the usual mains sewage.

##Sunlit caves - Thermal capacity of properties

One of the most enduring successes of BedZed had been the built-in functioning of the architecture. Bill Dunster’s ‘sunlit cave’ vision is a combination of thermal capacity walls and maximising sunlight that have contributed to keeping our energy bills down and making those properties that face South South West quite warm.

You may not be aware that there was an initial idea that the maisonettes were twinned with work spaces behind, with the idea that you just had to walk through to the back of your property to arrive at work. These units, as live/work units, were it seems impossible to get a mortgage on, so they were converted to pure living units.

##Rainwater toilets and gardening

Straight out of the gates Health & Safety stepped in a prevented the use of the rainwater for the gardens but the toilets were flushed for a number of years with the water from the roof.

That is until, so the story goes, the pigeons starting pooping in the Sedum.

I do recall seeing a South East water guy on his knees with his head down a manhole to the water tanks pouring in chlorine. He said he had to do it a couple of times a week to keep the water safe to use.

Not too long after the toilets were switched to the mains supply, We need to keep quiet on this since the water is unmetered and I don’t actually know who pays for it!

##Built in solar cells

While there is much better technology available now my understanding that some units are still working and the RA and Peabody were managing some of the issues.

##Recycling

We’re great at upcycling but not so good at recycling. Even having huge bins with stickers on about what may and may not go in some people just don’t seem to be bothered with rubbish but most people do.

##Food Waste Composting

For the first ten years or so some people took their food waste over to the compost bins through the fence. Unfortunately the design chosen needed manually rotating and after a few years it became more of a stinky rot fest.
In the last 5 years or so the Council have collected the food waste. Yay.

##Allotment

Originally on the other side of the fence, the cow troughs were bought with a grant! Why you ask! Because the sewage farm left just enough pooh in the ground to mean that the vegetables grown in the ground couldn’t be eaten. Great to see these are still going after 21 years.

##Electric car points

I’ve been told recently that the old ‘camping site’ style charge points are actually better than the new ones! While new. Of course electric cars have made more inroads around us today. Yay.

##Car Club

Still here!

##Community Centre & Bar

Now this was something. In the beginning there was a bar for residents and workers from Zedfactory and Bioregional. I believe Bill Dunster actually paid for at least one full fridges worth.

This has morphed in Nick’s Hackbridge Community Bar, now in the Pavilion and thankfully still with us.

What we call the Pavilion today did actually start out as a football changing rooms (thus the name). I think some of the cloakroom hangers and benches can still be found on the field. The field interestlingly was initially envisaged as a football field until it turned out that is was more or less a field of footballer-knee-cutting flints. These days the grass and some soil has built up!

##Community activities and spirit

Perhaps one of the most enduring achievements from the view of this resident has been the welcoming, creative and supportive community events that have continued through the years even with residents coming and going

##Bioregional and ZedFactory

I think the saddest loss to our community for me has been the moving off site of Bioregional and Zedfactory. May their business prosper.
